chaplin-mocha
=============

Boilerplate for a Chaplin/Backbone test environment using Mocha, Chai and Sinon

This test environment is ment to work the the Chaplin-Boilerplate as its source. It is written in Javascript, not Coffee. I added some really basic tests for the HelloWorldExample.

*Warning: This currently does not work due to some loading order issues with require.js-2.0.1 and Chaplin - it worked with require.js-1.x.x thought. I am trying to get this fixed soon.*
